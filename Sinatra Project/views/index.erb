    <p style="color:black;"><strong>Basic Blackjack Rules</strong></p><br>
    <p style="color:green">The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. <br>
Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.<br>
Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.<br>
To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.<br>
If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.<br>
If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace and 10), you got a blackjack.<br>
Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. Depends on the casino.<br>
Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.<br>
Doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled and you only get one more card.<br>
Split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands.<br>
Splitting also doubles the bet, because each new hand is worth the original bet.<br>
You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.<br>
You cannot play on two aces after they are split.<br>
You can double on a hand resulting from a split, tripling or quadrupling you bet.</p>
